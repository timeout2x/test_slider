Test slider task

Used techniques:
- Require.js (not really needed for project of this scale, just demonstration);
- Angular.js (MVVC framework, lighten than Backbone.js which would be an overkill here);
- jQuery (could have done without it also, used just for selector engine);
- Fade in/out transition used (though it can be easily switched to carousel one);
- Less - CSS preprocessor;
